;
; In BrainFuck language there are 8 commands:
;
;	. - Print the value of the current element 
;		in array 
;	, - Enter the value from command line to 
;		the current element in the array 
;	+ - Add 1 to the value of the current element  
;		in array 
;	- - Subtract 1 to the value of the current element  
;		in array 
;	< - Move pointer to the current element in array to the 
;		next element 
;	> - Move pointer to the current element in array to the
;		past element 
;	[ - Start the cycle if the value of the current element 
;		in array is not zero, if it is zero, then go the ] caracter 
;	] - Go back to the start of cycle 
;
;	In this interpreter nested cycles are allowed! 	
;


;
; 	By personal ideas I've introduced comments:
;
; There are two types of comments supported:
;	'#' comments - one line comments. All the caracters on the line	
;		after '#' symbol are not interpreting 
;	'/' comments - are multi line comments. All the caracters 
;		between the first and the second '/' are not interpreting  
;
